**Caesar Cipher (Shift) Encrypt** 

> The code implements a Caesar cipher, which is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the alphabet by a certain number of positions. The code first defines a list of lowercase letters, which it uses as the alphabet. It then takes three inputs from the user: the text to be encoded or decoded, the number of positions to shift the letters, and the direction ("encode" or "decode

The code then defines a function called `caesar_cipher` that takes these three inputs as arguments. The function first initializes an empty string to store the encoded or decoded text. It then iterates over each character in the input text. If the character is a letter, the function finds its index in the alphabet list. If the direction is "encode", the function shifts the index by the given number of positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. If the direction is "decode", the function shifts the index in the opposite direction. The function then retrieves the letter at the new index from the alphabet list and adds it to the encoded or decoded text. If the character is not a letter, the function simply adds it to the encoded or decoded text without modification.

Finally, the function returns the encoded or decoded text.

The code then calls the `caesar_cipher` function with the user input and prints the encoded or decoded text.


```
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

direction = input("Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:\n")
text = input("Type your message:\n").lower()
shift = int(input("Type the shift number:\n"))
```
**Explanation:**

* In this section, we first define the English alphabet as a list.

* Then, we prompt the user to choose the operation type (encryption or decryption) using the `input` function.

* After that, we prompt the user to enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted using the `input` function and convert it to lowercase.

* Finally, we prompt the user to enter the number of letters shifted using the input function and convert it to an integer.

  ```
  def caesar_cipher(text, shift, direction):
	encoded_text = ""
	for char in text:
		if char.isalpha():
			if direction == "encode":
				index = alphabet.index(char)
				encoded_text += alphabet[(index + shift) % 26]
			elif direction == "decode":
				index = alphabet.index(char)
				encoded_text += alphabet[(index - shift) % 26]
		else:
			encoded_text += char
	return encoded_text
  ```
**Explanation:**

In this section, we define a function called `caesar_cipher` that takes three inputs:

> `text:` The text to be encrypted or decrypted
> 
> `shift:` The number of letters shifted
> 
> `direction:` The operation type (encryption or decryption)

This function first defines an empty string called `encoded_text` to store the encrypted or decrypted text.

* Then, it iterates over each character in the input text using a `for` loop.

* If the character is a letter, the function finds its position in the alphabet list using the `index` function.

* If the operation type is "encode", the function adds the position of the character to the number of letters shifted and calculates the remainder of the division by 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) using the `%` operator. Then, it adds the letter at that position in the alphabet list to encoded_text.

* If the operation type is "decode", the function subtracts the position of the character from the number of letters shifted and calculates the remainder of the division by 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) using the `%` operator. Then, it adds the letter at that position in the alphabet list to encoded_text.

* If the character is not a letter, the function simply adds it to `encoded_text ` without modification.

* Finally, the function returns `encoded_text` which contains the encrypted or decrypted text.

```
result = caesar_cipher(text, shift, direction)
print(f"The {direction}d text is: {result}")
```
** Explanation: **

* In this section, we call the `caesar_cipher` function with the text, number of letters shifted, and operation type as inputs and store the result in the `result` variable.
* 
* Finally, we use the `print` function to display the encrypted or decrypted text to the user along with the operation type performed.
